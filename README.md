# AWID network anomaly detection and attack classification using ML
The present work aims to design and produce a tool based on machine learning for the detection of anomalies in an Iot network. In this work.

# Dataset
We chose to work on the AWID dataset, which is a collection of publicly available datasets in an easily distributable format. It includes Wi-Fi network data collected from the network environments.

We worked on the AWID-CLS-R dataset. This dataset contains two files AWID-CLS-R-Trn and AWID-CLS-R-Tst, which are the training set and the test data set, respectively, each record is represented by a vector of 156 attributes.the file col_names represents the list of all the attributes.
